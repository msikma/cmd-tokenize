/**
 * Takes a command string and returns an array of distinct argument blocks.
 * 
 * A command is anything the user may type into a terminal, such as `ls -lah`
 * or `find -type f -name '*.js'`. The argument blocks are the individual words
 * separated by spaces, with quoted sections having its internal spaces preserved.
 * Quoted sections are called "quotes" and whitespace-separated sections
 * are called "words".
 * 
 * For example, here's how the aforementioned `find` command would be split up:
 * 
 *     find -type f -name '*.js'
 *     [ 'find', '-type', 'f', '-name', '*.js' ]
 * 
 * Note that the outer quote characters around `*.js` were removed. These are no longer
 * needed when processing the input in Javascript.
 * 
 * There are several caveats and edge cases to be aware of regarding escape sequences.
 * Backslashes can be used to escape whitespace, single and double quotes, and itself;
 * inside of a quoted section, they escape only the outer quote character and itself.
 * 
 * During parsing, escape sequences are replaced with the characters they escape,
 * so for example `\"` becomes just a `"` double quote.
