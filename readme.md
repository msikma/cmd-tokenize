# cmd-tokenize

A small dependency-free library for converting terminal command strings into a format that's easy to process.

This is not a complete argument parsing library; for that, see [Argon](https://github.com/msikma/argon), for which this library was written. The purpose of this library is to split up terminal commands into separate distinct tokens that can then be processed further.

## Usage

This library is available via npm:

```
npm i --save cmd-tokenize
```

The primary interface is `parseCommand()`, which takes a string of a terminal command and returns an object of parsed arguments.

```js
const { parseCommand } = require('cmd-tokenize')

// Something the user entered in their terminal:
const cmd = `program arg --another-arg -z -asdf --with-value="value" -- --after-terminator`
const parsed = parseCommand(cmd)

console.log(parsed)

// Logs the following:
//
// {
//   command: 'program arg --another-arg -z -asdf --with-value="value" -- --after-terminator',
//   commandSplit: ['program', 'arg', '--another-arg', '-z', '-asdf', '--with-value=value', '--', '--after-terminator'],
//   arguments: [
//     {
//       value: 'program',
//       suffix: null,
//       prefix: null,
//       isAfterTerminator: false,
//       isExecutable: true,
//       isLongOption: false,
//       isOption: false,
//       isTerminator: false,
//       isUnpacked: false,
//       isKey: false,
//       isValue: false,
//       originalValue: 'program'
//     },
//     ...
```

Arguments are split by whitespace, with quoted sections remaining preserved. Both Unix and Windows style delimiters (dash and slash) are supported.

Alternatively, there's `splitCommand()` which only splits the input into distinct arguments without doing any further processing.

```js
const { splitCommand } = require('cmd-tokenize')

const cmd = `program arg "quoted arg" --arg='quoted arg' "nested \\"quote\\"" -abc`
const parsed = splitCommand(cmd)

console.log(parsed)

// Logs the following:
//
// ['program', 'arg', 'quoted arg', '--arg=quoted arg', 'nested "quote"', '-abc']
```

This function does not automatically parse options like `-abc` or `--argument="value"`. The result of this function can be used to spawn a child process.

### Options

For both these functions, the following options can be passed in an object as the second argument:

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| firstIsExec | boolean | true | Treats the first item as the path to the executable |
| preserveQuotes | boolean | false | Causes quotation marks around arguments to be preserved exactly |
| unpackCombinedOptions | boolean | true | Breaks up combined options into individual options; an argument like `-asdf` becomes `-a`, `-s`, `-d`, `-f` |
| useOptionsTerminator | boolean | true | Whether to look for the `--` terminator, which causes subsequent arguments to be treated verbatim |
| useWindowsDelimiters | boolean | false | Searches for Windows style slash delimiters rather than Unix style dash delimiters (never recommended even on Windows) |

In standard argument parsers, multiple short options such as `-a` may be combined into a single token, like `ls -lah` being equivalent to `ls -l -a -h`; these can be broken up for easier processing by setting `unpackCombinedOptions` to true. Conversely, if your parser does not distinguish between short and long options (one notable example being `ffmpeg`, which uses a single dash for both short and long options) you should leave it at its default of false.

The `useWindowsDelimiters` option should be set to true when writing a parser for commands with Windows style slash arguments, such as `program.exe /a /b /c`. These are fundamentally incompatible with Unix style paths, which are now being used on Windows as well (per the introduction of the [WSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux)), so it's recommended that you *always* use Unix style arguments regardless of what platform you're writing for. Note that, if you do parse Windows style slash arguments, you should also set `useOptionsTerminator` to false as this is not a convention used on Windows.

The `firstIsExec` option ensures that the first item is parsed correctly if it's the name of the executable (e.g. the `ls` in `ls -lah`); technically an executable file can be named `--something`, which should not be parsed as an argument if it is the executable name. If you're *only* parsing arguments without an executable name, use `parseArguments()` instead of `parseCommand()`.

### Argument metadata

After parsing, each argument will have the following metadata:

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| value | string | String content of the argument with all delimiters stripped; `"foo"` for `--foo` |
| suffix | string&nbsp;\|&nbsp;null | Suffix delimiter, if present; `"="` for `--foo="bar"` |
| prefix | string&nbsp;\|&nbsp;null | Prefix delimiter, if present; `"--"` for `--foo` |
| isAfterTerminator | boolean | Whether this argument came after the terminator |
| isExecutable | boolean | Whether this argument is the executable (the first item); true for `mkdir` in the command `mkdir -p /some/path`, false for the rest of the items |
| isLongOption | boolean | Whether this argument's option is a double hyphens; false for `-f`, true for `--foo` |
| isOption | boolean | Whether this argument is an option; true for `-f` or `--foo`, false for `foo` |
| isTerminator | boolean | Whether this is the `"--"` terminator argumentâ€”[see the syntax conventions section on Argon's readme page](https://github.com/msikma/argon#syntax-conventions) |
| isUnpacked | boolean | Whether this argument is a split up combination argument; an argument like `-asdf` becomes `-a`, `-s`, `-d`, `-f` |
| isKey | boolean | Whether this argument is the key in a key-value pair; for `--foo="bar"`, the key item is `foo` |
| isValue | boolean | Whether this argument is the value in a key-value pair; for `--foo="bar"`, the value item is `bar` |
| originalValue | string | The original string that made up the argument, before any processing was done |

The `value` string will be stripped of whitespace *except if the argument was quoted*, in which case the whitespace will be maintained. So if the following string is parsed:

```
program  --hello  " world "
```

the `value` strings will be `['my_program', '--hello', ' world ']`. This is done under the assumption that, if something is quoted, its whitespace must be meaningful.

Nested quotes are handled correctly up to arbitrary depth, with the important detail that the quotation depth (the number of escape backslashes before a quote) is reduced by one. This is because, as the items are being split up from a string into an array, we no longer need the first layer: `argument` and `"argument with spaces"` become `['argument', 'argument with spaces']`. If the quotation marks need to be preserved, set the `preserveQuotes` option to true.
